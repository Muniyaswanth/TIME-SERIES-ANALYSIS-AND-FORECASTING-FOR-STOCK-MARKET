📈 Stock Market Prediction using Time Series Forecasting
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using different time series forecasting techniques.
The main goal is to analyze stock price patterns and build models that can forecast future trends with higher accuracy.

We implemented and compared multiple forecasting models:

ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

📂 Dataset

Data collected using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) API

Stock prices include:

Open Price

High Price

Low Price

Close Price

Volume

Adjusted Close Price

Preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values

Converting date columns to datetime

Train-test splitting for time series

🚀 Implementation
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend analysis of stock price movements

Visualization of closing price history

Plotting moving averages and seasonality

2. Forecasting Models

ARIMA: Captures autoregressive and moving average components.

SARIMA: Accounts for seasonality in stock prices.

LSTM: Deep learning model trained on sequential price data.

3. Evaluation Metrics

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

📊 Results

ARIMA gave baseline performance.

SARIMA improved accuracy with seasonality adjustment.

LSTM achieved the lowest RMSE, capturing complex price patterns better.
